## Overview

The Spreadsheet Application is a lightweight and functional tool I built for managing and calculating spreadsheet data. Itâ€™s split into two main parts: SpreadsheetApp, which handles the user interface, and SpreadsheetEngine, which takes care of the computational logic. This project was a learning experience where I explored integrating a GUI with a powerful backend engine capable of evaluating expressions, managing spreadsheet structures, and implementing undo/redo functionality. It was made to learn software design patterns and principles.
